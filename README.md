Programs that automate the following parts of online learning provided by my school:
	getting all the educational material in the form of pdfs from the school website
	
	
	making a pdf from images and mailing the assignment to the school email
	
	
	remind me when an online zoom class is about about begin and provide the id and password of the meeting
	
	

Details:
	All the data files contain personal informartion and hence are not in this repository.
	
	
	Code pictures are taken using the amazing https://codeimg.io/
	
	
	All programes are ran using .exe files on windows (hence I don't need the code so I stashed it here)
	
	
	The "Zoom class.exe" is run every morning using the task manager and it wait for the time to occur
	
	
	The  "send assessment.exe" is run by putting the pdfs into the "pages" folder in the manner demonstrated after which the program is run.
